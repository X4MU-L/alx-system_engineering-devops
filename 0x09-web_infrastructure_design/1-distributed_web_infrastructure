Concepts and Knowledge gained

- To allow for data integrity and separation of concerns, only the application server can transact with the database direct.

- My load balancer is implemented to use a Round robin algorithm.

- This design did not implement Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) for the database, nor does our data have any backup, This can be seen as a SPOF, should our database gets overloaded or fails for any reason.

- This cluster also uses an Active-Active High availability Solution this also helps improve scalability, since no monitoring mechanism is currently employed I believe this would best serve the custer instead of an Active-Passive High availability Solution.

- There is also no Firewall on this cluster and makes prone to DOS attacks.

- We currently have one application server serving both servers with no backup, this can be identified as another SPOF.
